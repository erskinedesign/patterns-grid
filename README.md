# EDX Grid Pattern
A customisable, fully responsive grid system with multiple breakpoints.


## Features
- Fluid grid.
- Nesting (only one layer deep though).
- Add viewport-specific classes to the cells.
- Supports multiple grid types (grid--a, grid--b, etc).
- No .clear, .start, .end or .last classes.
- Push classes left or right for more customisation.
- Grid toggler for viewing 

## Problems
- Creates an enormous amount of CSS (we suggest you use a Grunt tool to remove unused classes).

#### Grid toggler
The grid toggler hides the `.grid--overlay` wrapper and automatically generates the number of columns that is being used in the `.grid--overlay` modifier. This means that if we update the number of columns in the overlay we wonâ€™t have change the script at all. 

The grid toggler is written in plain Javascript so that we can move this into an asynchronous module later on if we wish.
