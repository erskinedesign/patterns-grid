# Grid
Default go-to grid system with common modules built in for easy setup grids.


### Rules
- Separate grid container from grid columns
- Add viewport-specific classes to the cells, (medium--1of3, large--5of7,etc)
- Supports multiple grid types (grid--a, grid--b, etc)
- Backwards compatible with IE8 and up
- No .clear, .start, .end or .last classes
- Should be able to center columns
- Lightweight + fast (compiles into small amount of CSS)
- Complimentary JS toggler button
- Sometimes need children of a grid to break the width of a column
